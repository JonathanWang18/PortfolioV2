                <p class="col-md-6 projecttextalignment"> The objective in this project was to create a functioning winch system that incorporates a drum with a weight attached to a string. My responsibilities were to create a NetLogo simulation program that imitates the behavior of the winch system. I learned about the importance of drum size and how they affected the efficiency of the system. Larger drums have a larger linear velocity than smaller drums, which makes them better for rotating lengths of string around them in a winch system. An important skill that was exemplified with my team was time management. As the project deadline approached, our team was forced to spend more time working on the project in order to finish our deliverables.</p>
