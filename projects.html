                <p class="col-md-6 projecttextalignment"> The objective for this <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n_9Ke01_afPO_RiuX44yjxV6Reo6W1GwEss1mVc9sR0/edit?usp=sharing">project</a> was to create an AOI logic circuit meant to simulate a cybersecurity service that detects three different types of malware. Each type of malware would be detected through 3 inputs each, with 1 input that is common throughout all of the malware types. When malware is detected, there is a seperate output used to determine if users should wipe their computer to eliminate the malware. Since this was a team project, my individual task was to design the Trojan portion of the circuit. I had to use an AND gate and OR gate to fulfill specific conditions for the Trojan malware to be detected at certain input combinations. To determine the different input combinations, I created a truth table and simplified a logic expression to build the circuit.</p>

                <p class="col-md-6 projecttextalignment"> After being introduced to programmable logic devices, the goal for this project was to create an LED lightshow that consisted of sixteen unique stages. A seven segment display was used to showcase a pattern of alternating LED lights which all had their own AOI logic configurations. A four-bit flip flop counter was used to automatically alternate between stages. This project was meant to showcase the versatility of PLD circuits and how it reduces the need to manually breadboard integrated components. As an individual assignment, I was tasked with designing the simulation and physically running it on a breadboard. Project <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HdLmkEjTbGfOYqeGSNBkA1vydN_fF_19i1An8j0C9i0/edit?usp=sharing">documentation</a> included truth tables, screenshots, and summaries for the final design. Based on the LED pattern, it affected which LED segments would be on and how complex each logic expression would be.</p>
