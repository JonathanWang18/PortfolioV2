                        <p class=" indent" >My name is Jonathan Wang, and my goal is to learn more about the different fields of engineering. Pertaining to my ideal career, Iâ€™m extremely interested in programming and working with computers because they have had a significant impact on the modern world. I am a 12th grader at Dublin High School. I have already taken courses such as AP Computer Science A and I am currently taking PLTW Digital Electronics. I also like to design my own webpage to display my experiences and projects in engineering. In the nearby future, I plan on attending a 4-year college after I graduate from high school. I am interested in majoring in Computer Engineering or Electrical Engineering to further my goal. <br></p>

                        <p class=" indent" > My passion for engineering developed as I entered high school. I took an introductory Computer Science Principles course where I learned various programming languages. From that moment, I continued to take more related courses that varied in content. The satisfaction of creating something useful for others helps motivate me to continue developing and working on projects. My dream is to have the skills and knowledge that will enable me to work with others to develop things.<br></p>
                
                        <p class=" indent" >Some personal strengths I have are the ability to effectively communicate with my team. As an officer for a school club, I helped arrange work sessions for our club to work on projects we decided on. Assigning roles and setting up realistic goals with our current timeframe was essential for us to develop a prototype needed for the project. I am also very adaptable to changes in the work environment. As the Covid-19 pandemic became widespread, I had to adjust to the new schooling environment that took place online as I quarantined. <br></p>
                
                        <p class=" indent" >Some of my favorite experiences include writing for a school-run tech forum called Tech Archives. I had never written articles for any organization before so I learned a lot about researching various topics and presenting that information concisely. I am also proud of a modified remote-controlled car that my friends and I developed in a club. In that project, we all became interested in learning how Raspberry Pis worked and the different uses they provided. I am fluent in English and proficient in Chinese. I can work with HTML and CSS which are frequently used for web development. I am also currently learning digital electronics which may be useful for future careers in engineering.<br></p>
                
                        <p class=" indent" >While I am currently a 12th grader, I have already learned many things about myself. I have discovered that I work well with many of my other peers during projects, allowing us to overcome challenges. I have also discovered a desire to learn new skills in engineering that allows me to create connections with other individuals that are passionate about learning as well. </p>
