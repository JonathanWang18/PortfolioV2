                    <p class="indent" >During my time in high school, I have explored careers that interest me by enrolling in relevant courses that were offered. Starting from my high school freshman year, I took PLTW Computer Science Principles which helped me establish a novice foundation in programming and web design. I was taught how to work with all sorts of computer languages ranging from Python to HTML. It was through this experience that inspired me to pursue a career that was involved in software development. <br></p>

                    <p class="indent" >In my sophomore year, I decided to expand the scope of my current knowledge by taking Principles of Engineering. Unlike my previous experience, this course was much more physics-oriented and covered concepts ranging from thermodynamics to the laws of electricity. During this time, there was one particular project where I was assigned to research the field of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. In doing so, I was able to grasp an in-depth understanding of the types of systems that the discipline dealt with and what types of skills were required. Instead of pursuing a career solely involved with software development, I shifted my goal to be involved with both programming and electronic hardware. Over the course of my last two years at high school, I would take courses such as AP Computer Science A and Digital Electronics to get improve my skillset for the future.<br></p>
